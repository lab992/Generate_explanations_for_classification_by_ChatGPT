Based on your description of classes, the data sample you provided would fall into the 'shake hand' class. 

The primary reason for this classification is the predominance of 'a lot of changes in the direction'. This main feature matches exactly to the 'shake hand' gesture as per your classifications. 

Although the data also has a 'big decreasing trend' and 'a lot of increasing values' which could potentially match to 'move to left' class, but that requires 'few changes in direction', which is not the case here.

Moreover, the presence of 'a big decreasing trend' directly contradicts the classification for 'move to right' since it requires a 'slight decreasing trend'.

Therefore, considering all factors, this data sample aligns best with the 'shake hand' gesture as it matches its defining characteristic of 'a lot of changes in the direction', making other features less consequential in this classification scenario.

In conclusion, your classification for the described data sample is [Class: 'shake hand'].
Based on the descriptions you've given, the data sample provided is best classified as the gesture 'shake hand'.

Here's the explanation:

The main distinguishing feature of the 'shake hand' gesture, according to your descriptions, is a lot of changes in direction. This, essentially, is what denotes the back-and-forward movement involved in a handshake. The dataset you've described shows that characteristic prominently. Despite that it also shows a big decreasing trend and a lot of increasing values, these indications do not strongly signify 'move to left' or 'move to right' due to the more significant (large) amount of changes in direction in the data.

To recall the other classes, 'move to left' is characterized by few changes in the direction and a big decreasing trend. 'Move to right' has few changes in the direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values. However, these are not the prominent characteristics in the dataset presented.

Therefore, largely due to the high frequency of changes in direction, we conclude that this dataset sample is reminiscent of the 'shake hand' gesture.

So, to repeat the conclusion in your desired format: [Class: Shake Hand].
The data sample can be analyzed as follows according to the classes' description: 

There are a lot of changes in the direction, which primarily signifies 'shake hand'. But let's look into the other characteristics too. There's a big decreasing trend, which signals towards 'move to left'. However, there's a contradiction here, because for 'move to left' class, the description mentions few changes in direction but in the data sample, there are a lot of direction changes. Finally, there are a lot of increasing values which isn't a clear signal towards any of the given gestures.

Given these points of contradiction, the most dominant feature is the 'a lot of changes in the direction' which primarily classifies this data sample to 'shake hand'. This is because 'shake hand' is the only gesture that exhibits a lot of changes in the direction according to the descriptions given. 

[Class: shake hand]

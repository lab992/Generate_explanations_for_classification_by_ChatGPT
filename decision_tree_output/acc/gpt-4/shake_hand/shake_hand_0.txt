Based on your descriptions, the given data sample belongs to the 'shake hand' class. Even though there's a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values, the critical factor that determines the classification here seems to be the number of changes in direction. Since the sample shows a lot of these changes, it is most likely that this is a 'shake hand' gesture. 

This deduction is made based on your rule that if there's a lot of changes in direction, regardless of other conditions, the gesture should be classified as 'shake hand'.

In conclusion, the gesture is classified as [Class: shake hand].
Based on the given descriptions of the gestures and the features of the provided data sample, the gesture can be classified as 'shake hand'.
Explanation:
In the provided data sample, there are a lot of changes in the direction, which is a defining characteristic of a 'shake hand' gesture, as per the descriptions provided. Though there's a slight decreasing trend, it does not necessarily mean that the gesture is 'move to left' because it's also mentioned that this gesture has a lot of increasing values, which is not the case in the sample. The 'move to right' gesture also has a slight decreasing trend but in combination with few changes in direction, and few increasing values, which is partly true for our sample but not sufficient to conclude it as such due to the high number of direction changes. 

In the light of these points, the gesture with most matching characteristics to the provided data is 'shake hand'.
[Class: shake hand]
Based on the given descriptions of the gestures:

- There's a lot of changes in the direction, which indicates a 'shake hand' gesture. 
- However, there is a slight decreasing trend present, which is not evident in the 'shake hand' gesture based on the descriptions provided. The 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures possess a decreasing trend. 
- With fewer increasing values, in combination with the slight decreasing trend, it becomes more indicative of the 'move to right' gesture than the 'move to left' one, as 'move to left' involves a lot of increasing values, which isn't the case here.

So, this combination of data points may best be classified as the 'move to right' gesture, although the considerable variance in direction could arguably suggest some elements of a 'shake hand' gesture, this action does not normally possess a decreasing trend according to your description.

[Class: Move to right]
Based on your description, the data sample can be classified as 'shake hand'. As per your rule, a lot of changes in the direction point to a 'shake hand' gesture. A slight decreasing trend or few increasing values don't change the gesture that is indicated by a lot of changes in direction. 

This inference is made because when shaking hands, the hand movement direction changes frequently as you move up and down. In contrast, when moving to the left or right, the hand's direction change is more limited because the motion is primarily in one direction.

As such:

[Class: 'shake hand']
Based on your provided descriptions and the data sample for classification, we need to look at three aspects: the number of changes in direction, the trends in decrease, and the number of increasing values. 

Given:

1. A lot of changes in direction.
2. A slight decreasing trend.
3. Few increasing values. 

Now according to the classification rules:

- "Shake hand" gesture is characterized by a lot of direction changes. 
- "Move to left" gesture is distinguished by few directional changes, significant decrease and lots of increase.
- "Move to right" gesture represents few direction changes, slight decrease, and few increase.

The provided data sample matches best with the "shake hand" gesture because it has a lot of changes in direction like the 'shake hand' gesture. Even though the sample also has a slight decreasing trend, the "shake hand" classification does not specify the nature or requirement of the trend, and hence it could accommodate a slight decreasing trend. Moreover, while 'move to right' also has a slight decrease trend, it differs as it have few direction changes unlike this case. 

Therefore, based on the descriptions and the provided data sample, I would classify this as a "shake hand" gesture due to the high number of changes in direction.

[Class: shake hand]

Based on the criteria you provided, the sample you described fits best with the 'move to right' gesture class. Here's why:

The given sample has few changes in the direction, which aligns with all gestures except for 'shake hand', so we can rule out the 'shake hand' class.

Next, the sample is characterized by a slight decreasing trend. This trait aligns with both 'move to left' and 'move to right' classes. But we need to check the last feature to make a final decision.

Finally, the sample has few increasing values. This feature aligns only with the 'move to right' gesture. For 'move to left', the presence of a lot of increasing values is emphasised, so 'move to left' does not meet this criteria.

Therefore, considering all of the three main features of the provided sample, it best fits the 'move to right' gesture class.

[Class: move to right]
Based on the features described and the rules provided, this data sample would be classified as 'move to right'. 

There are few changes in the direction which satisfy the criteria for both 'move to left' and 'move to right'. However, the slight decreasing trend coupled with few increasing values are exclusive features of the 'move to right' classification. These features don't match with the description given for 'move to left' as it requires a big decreasing trend or a lot of increasing values. Therefore, we don't classify this sample in the 'move to left' category.

So, the features of the data sample precisely match the description of the 'move to right' gesture.

[Class: move to right]
Based on the provided rules, a data sample that has few changes in direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values would be classified as the 'move to right' gesture. 

This is inferred from the matching attributes. The conditions for 'move to right' gesture strictly specify that there should be few changes in direction, slight decreasing trend and few increasing values, which matches exactly the characteristics of the provided sample data. 

To reiterate, the classification of the data sample based on the provided details is as follows: [Class: move to right].
Based on your descriptions, the provided data sample can be classified into the 'move to right' class. This is due to the following observations: 

1. Few Changes in Direction: This characteristic matches two of your class descriptions: 'move to left' and 'move to right'. However, it automatically eliminates the possible classification of 'shake hand', as you described this gesture as having a lot of changes in direction which is not observed in the data sample. 

2. Slight Decreasing Trend: From your description, both 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures exhibit this trait. 

3. Few Increasing Values: This feature is the key discriminator for our classification. According to your description, the 'move to left' gesture should have a lot of increasing values, which doesn't correspond to our data sample. On the other hand, the 'move to right' gesture does align with this feature as it's described as having few increasing values, which is seen in our sample.

By comparing these observations with your gesture descriptions, we can infer the 'move to right' classification for the provided data sample.

[Class: move to right]
According to your stipulations, if a data sample presents few changes in direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values, then it is referred to as the 'move to right' gesture.

This classification relies on these three features. The presense of few changes in direction implies that the motion is steady in the x-axis without much variabillity, suggestive of a simple horizontal movement rather than a complex pattern. The slight decreasing trend reflects a gradual reduction in acceleration, indicating the slowing down of the motion towards the right direction. The few increasing values further suggest that the motion is consistently heading in a single direction rather than bouncing back and forth.

Therefore, because your data sample presents these characteristics, it can be classified as a 'move to right' gesture.

[Class: move to right].

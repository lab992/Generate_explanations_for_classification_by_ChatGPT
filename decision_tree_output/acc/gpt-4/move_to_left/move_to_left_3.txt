Based on the given descriptions, the provided data sample can be classified as 'move to right'. Here's why:

The conditions described in the sample match the conditions given for the 'move to right' class. Namely:

1. There are few changes in the direction: This matches the condition stated in the description for 'move to right' as well as 'move to left'. However, the next two conditions will help differentiate between these two possibilities.
   
2. There's a slight decreasing trend: This condition matches the 'move to right' and the 'move to left' gestures description provided by you. However, the main difference is that in 'move to left', there should be a lot of increasing values which is not the case here indicating that 'move to right' is more appropriate.

3. There's few increasing values: This is the final matching condition which corresponds to 'move to right' class. This condition is not fulfilled by the 'move to left' gesture, instead, it requires more increasing values.

Taken together, these matchings indicate the 'move to right' classification.

[Class: 'move to right']
Based on your description and classification rules, the sample can be categorized as the 'move to right' gesture. Here's why:

The provided sample has few changes in direction, slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values. According to your description of classes, this pattern of features corresponds to the 'move to right' gesture. Specifically,

1. There are few changes in the direction - matching the criteria for 'move to left' and 'move to right'
2. A slight decreasing trend is observed, eliminating the possibility of 'move to left' which needs a big decreasing trend. Now, it's between 'shake hand' and 'move to right'
3. Few increasing values are also noticed. Considering 'shake hand' should have lots of direction changes, it leaves us with 'move to right' which exactly fits the criteria: few changes of direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values.

So, according to your guidelines and the observed features of the described data, gesture classification is: [Class: move to right].
Based on the given rules, the data sample is classified as 'move to right'. The reasons are as follows:

- The data sample has few changes in the direction. This makes it suitable for the 'move to left' and 'move to right' classes as both require few changes in the direction.
- The data sample depicts a slight decreasing trend which is compatible with both 'move to left' and 'move to right'.
- Finally, the data sample shows few increasing values, which is the distinguishing feature for the 'move to right' class as per the given descriptions.

Therefore, when all features of the data sample are considered together, they match the description for the 'move to right' gesture.

[Class: move to right]
Based on the provided descriptions of the three classes and the properties of the given data sample, we can classify the data sample as 'move to right'. 

This is mainly due to three reasons:

1. Few Changes in Direction: The data sample shows there are few changes in direction. Both the 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures match with this description, but it doesn't match the 'shake hand' gesture which involves a lot of direction changes. 

2. Slight Decreasing Trend: The data sample presents a slight decreasing trend. This trait is common in both the 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures. However, the 'move to left' gesture should have a significant (big) decreasing trend and not a slight one. So the 'move to left' gesture can be ruled out at this point.

3. Few Increasing Values: The data sample has only a few increasing values. This matches with the 'move to right' gesture which also has few increasing values, while the 'move to left' gesture should have a lot of increasing values according to the provided description.

These are the reasons why we can infer this data sample to 'move to right' gesture.

[Class: move to right]
Based on the provided descriptions and features of the given data sample:

- Few changes in direction
- A slight decreasing trend
- Few increasing values

We will classify this as 'move to right'.

Explanation:

Gestures are classified based on 3 features: changes in direction, presence of a decreasing trend, and amount of increasing values. 

Starting with the changes in direction. The guidelines state that if there's a lot of changes in direction, then it would typically represent a 'shake hand' gesture. However, in this instance, the data sample demonstrates few changes in direction. This immediately rules out the 'shake hand' classification.

Next, we observe a slight decreasing trend in the values. Combined with the first feature - few changes in direction - this gives us two potential classifications: 'move to left' or 'move to right'. However, this is not enough to make a definite classification, and so we have to consider the third feature.

The third feature is the presence of increasing values. The guidelines state that a lot of increasing values paired with few changes in direction and a slight decreasing trend signifies a 'move to left' gesture. However, this data sample demonstrates few increasing values. So, based on the information provided, this data sample would be classified as a 'move to right' gesture, due to the presence of few changes in direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values.

Therefore, the classification for the given data sample is: [Class: 'move to right'].

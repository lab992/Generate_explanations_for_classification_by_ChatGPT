Based on the class descriptions provided and the characteristics of your data, the gesture would most likely be classified as 'move to left'. 

Explanation:
- Few changes in direction: This feature aligns with each of the conditions for 'move to left' and 'move to right'.
- Big decreasing trend: This specific feature is only mentioned in the condition for 'move to left'.
- Few increasing values: This aligns with 'move to right', but since we have a big decreasing trend, which is stated for 'move to left', it has more weight.

So based on the prevalence and weight of the features, the data matches best with 'move to left'. 

[Class: move to left]
Based on the provided descriptions of the classes, the given sample data can be classified into the 'move to left' gesture. This is because the sample data shows few changes in the direction and a big decreasing trend, which matches the description for 'move to left'. The sample also shows few increasing values which also complies with the defined gesture. 

In terms of acceleration, few changes in direction would mean that the movement is largely in a single direction, while a big decreasing trend in the x-axis would typically mean that the movement is towards the left (negative direction in a standard x,y plane). Hence, this overall pattern fits the 'move to left' gesture.

[Class: move to left].
Based on the provided descriptions, the sample data corresponds to the 'move to left' gesture. This is inferred from the fact that there are few changes in direction: this eliminates the possibility of the 'shake hand' gesture; and there's a big decreasing trend, which points to 'move to left', not 'move to right'. Although there are few increasing values, it isn't contradictory with the description for 'move to left', as it doesn't mention a specific trend on increasing values.

Looking closer, the 'move to right' gesture is described to also have few changes in direction and slight decreasing trend, but it specifies few increasing values. The key difference here is between a 'slight' and 'big' decreasing trend, and the presented sample data pointed to a 'big' decreasing trend. So it doesn't fit the 'move to right' category.

[Class: 'move to left'].
Based on your stated criteria, such data would be classified as belonging to the 'move to left' gesture class. The reasoning is as followed:

- The data have few changes in the direction, which, according to your definitions, eliminates 'shake hand' as a possible classification, leaving only 'move to left' and 'move to right'.

- The data also present a big decreasing trend. According to your descriptions, this attribute is associated exclusively with 'move to left' gesture class. The 'move to right' class is specified by a slight decreasing trend, not a big one. 

- Additionally, the data have few increasing values. This feature does not play a role in differentiating between 'move to left' or 'move to right', as both these categories can have few increasing values.

Taking all details into consideration, the data with few changes in direction, big decreasing trend and few increasing values can be classified as matching the 'move to left' gesture. 

[Class: Move to Left]
Based on the descriptions:

- Few changes in the direction: This indicates that the movement isn't frequently changing direction, therefore we can conclude that the 'shake hand' gesture isn't relevant because it involves a lot of directional changes.

- Big decreasing trend: This suggests the acceleration is in the negative x direction more often than not, which represents a leftward movement. It matches the condition for the 'move to left' gesture but contradicts the condition for the 'move to right' gesture as the latter involves a slight decreasing trend.

- Few increasing values: This further supports the observation of a prominent decreasing trend but does not match the condition stated for the leftover possible choice of the 'move to left' gesture, which includes lots of increasing values as part of its description.

By deduction, none of the gestures perfectly match all of the stated conditions. However, we could infer based on the decreasing trend quality, and the fact that the 'move to right' gesture is the only other option with a decreasing trend in its conditions, that the gesture is closer to 'move to right'.

Therefore, given the revealed data sample characteristics above, the sample can most closely be classified as the 'move to right' gesture.

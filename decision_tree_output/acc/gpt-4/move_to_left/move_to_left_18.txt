Based on the description provided, this data sample can be classified as the 'move to left' gesture. The reasons for this are as follow:

1. Few changes in direction: This suggests that the movement isn't back and forth (like a hand shake) but is instead largely in one direction. This matches the criteria for both 'move to left' and 'move to right'.
2. Big decreasing trend: A major decrease in trend indicates a movement in negative direction on the x-axis. This is indicative of the 'move to left' gesture.
3. Few increasing values: The lack of significant positive values means that the activity is not swinging back towards the positive side very often. This eliminates 'move to right' which has a slight decreasing trend but more instances of increasing values.

So, based on the given description and criteria, the data sample represents a 'move to left' gesture.

[Class: Move to Left]
Based on the provided descriptions of each gesture and the features of the data sample, the sample is classified as 'move to left'. This is inferred from the features of the data sample, which includes few changes in the direction and a big decreasing trend. The mention of few increasing values does not impact this classification as it's not a defining feature for 'move to left' gesture.

Following the required format: 

[Class: move to left]
The description 'There's few changes in the direction. There's a big decreasing trend. There's few increasing values.' matches perfectly with the explanation for 'move to left'. 

According to the provided descriptions for the gestures:

'Shake hand' - Includes a lot of changes in direction. However, this sample has few changes. So it cannot be 'Shake hand'.
'Move to left' - Has few changes in the direction, a big decreasing trend, and according to the sample data, it matches this description. 
'Move to right' - Would need few changes in the direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values. While it matches some of the parameters, the sample has a big and not a slight decreasing trend.

Considering the above statement corresponding definitions, it's clear that 'There's few changes in the direction.There's a big decreasing trend.There's few increasing values.' is a description of the 'move to left' gesture.

[Class: move to left]
The given data sample can be classified as 'Move to Left'. According to the given class descriptions, if the data has few changes in direction (meaning, it's relatively steady) along with a big decreasing trend (indicating movement in a specific direction), then it can be classified as 'Move to Left'. In this case, you also mentioned that there are few increasing values, which further supports this classification, as the description for 'Move to Left' doesn't require many increasing values unlike 'Move to Right'.

Therefore, based on the description provided, the data sample matches closely with the class 'Move to Left'.

So, to repeat my answer in the required format: [Class: Move to Left].
Given that there are few changes in direction, a significant decreasing trend, and few increasing values, this would align with the description provided for the 'move to left' class. This is because these features are exhibited by this classification, particularly the notable decreasing trend which indicates a significant shift or movement in the 'left' direction, as well as few changes in direction, suggesting a singular, focused movement. Thus, we can infer this gesture is 'move to left'.

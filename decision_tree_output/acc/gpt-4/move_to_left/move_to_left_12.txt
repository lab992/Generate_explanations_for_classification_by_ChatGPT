Based on the description of the data sample and the definitions of the three gesture classes, this data sample would be classified as 'move to left'. Here's a breakdown as to why:

- Few changes in the direction: both 'move to left' and 'move to right' are defined as having few changes in direction. 
- A big decreasing trend: this specifically aligns with 'move to left'. 
- Few increasing values: this indication is more common with 'move to right' as per your definitions, but if we consider the 'big decreasing trend' as the overriding factor, the data sample still aligns more closely with 'move to left'.

To sum up, based on the aforementioned factors, while there are characteristics that align with both 'move to left' and 'move to right', the 'big decreasing trend' makes it more likely to be 'move to left', so that will be the classification according to the given descriptions of the samples.

[Class: move to left]
Based on the descriptions given, I would classify this sample as 'move to left' due to the few changes in direction and the presence of a big decreasing trend. The samples with few changes in direction are either 'move to left' or 'move to right'. However, the 'move to right' is characterized by a slight, not big, decreasing trend. 

Also, you mentioned that there are few increasing values in this sample. However, since the 'move to left' doesn't specify the number of increasing values as a distinguishing characteristic, this doesn't disqualify it as a 'move to left'.

By process of elimination and the presence of the strong decreasing trend, 'move to left' is the best fit for these data characteristics.

[Class: move to left]
Based on the provided description, we would classify the data sample as the 'move to left' gesture. 

The key reasons for this classification are: 
- Few changes in the direction: This fits the requirement for the 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures as both require few directional changes.
- A big decreasing trend: This matches the 'move to left' gesture as it is the only one that specifies a big decrease trend.
- Few increasing values: While this does not help more specifically categorize the gesture this further confirms that this is 'move to left' as the 'move to right' gesture requires few increasing values.

Therefore, considering all the given features, the gesture can be characterized as 'move to left'. 

[Class: Move to left]
Based on the given conditions and descriptions of classes, the data sample could be classified as 'move to left'. There are a few reasons for this:

1) There are few changes in the direction: this feature suggests a consistent motion and aligns with the features of both 'move to left' and 'move to right'. However, the other motion ('shake hand') is ruled out, as it involves a lot of change in direction.

2) There is a big decreasing trend: It means there are a lot of values that are getting lesser over time, which clearly aligns with the feature of 'move to left' class.

3) Few increasing values: If this term is compared in the description of classes, only 'move to left' and 'move to right' are having few increasing values. However, as per the above point, 'move to right' can be ruled out here as it is associated with a slight decreasing trend, not a big one.

According to these points, the data sample could be classified as 'move to left'.

[Class: move to left]
Based on the descriptions provided:

- There are few changes in direction, which suggests that the gesture is not 'shake hand'. 
- There is a big decreasing trend, which points towards the gesture 'move to left'. 
- There are few increasing values, which is also consistent with the 'move to left' gesture.

So, your gesture is classified as 'move to left'. This classification is inferred from the fact that there are few changes in direction and few increasing values, combined with a substantial decreasing trend - all these characteristics, according to the descriptions, correspond with the 'move to left' gesture.

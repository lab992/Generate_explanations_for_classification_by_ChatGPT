To determine the class that the given array belongs to, we need to check for both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2' as described in the instructions.

For 'Situation 1', we need to check if there is a 0 followed by a 9. Let's go step by step and see if this condition is satisfied:

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
The array contains a 0 at index 54.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Yes, there is a 9 after the 0 in the array.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of the 9 at index 54 is indeed greater than the index of the 0 at index 54.

Therefore, the given array satisfies 'Situation 1' and can potentially belong to 'Class 2'.

Moving on to 'Situation 2', we need to check if there is a 9 followed by a 0. Let's go step by step and see if this condition is satisfied:

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
The array contains a 9 at index 58.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Yes, there is a 0 after the 9 in the array.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
The index of the 0 at index 59 is indeed greater than the index of the 9 at index 58.

Therefore, the given array also satisfies 'Situation 2' and can potentially belong to 'Class 2'.

Since the given array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', the answer is:

Result: Class 2
------------------------
To determine the class that the given array belongs to, we need to evaluate whether it satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

For 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Find a 0. The array does contain a 0.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0. The array does have a 9 after the 0.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0. The index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

For 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Find a 9. The array does contain a 9.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9. The array does have a 0 after the 9.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9. The index of 0 is not greater than the index of 9.

Based on the evaluation, the array satisfies 'Situation 1' but does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Therefore, the result is: 'Result: Class 3'.
------------------------
Result: Class2
------------------------
Result: Class2
------------------------
To classify which class this array belongs to, we need to check if it satisfies the conditions for 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
We have a 0 at index 50.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Yes, there is a 9 after 0 at index 54.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 (index 54) is greater than the index of 0 (index 50).

Therefore, this array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
We have a 9 at index 52.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Yes, there is a 0 after 9 at index 53.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
The index of 0 (index 53) is greater than the index of 9 (index 52).

Therefore, this array satisfies 'Situation 2'.

Since the array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', the result is:
Result: Class2
------------------------

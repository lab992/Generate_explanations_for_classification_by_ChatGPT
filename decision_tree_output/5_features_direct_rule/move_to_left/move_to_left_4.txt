Based on the given description, the characteristics of the sample can be classified as follows:

- Few changes in the direction: Indicates that the movement is consistent without significant changes.
- Big decreasing trend: Suggests that the acceleration values are progressively decreasing over time.
- Few increasing values: Implies that there are only a few instances where the acceleration values increase.
- Dynamic: Indicates that the movement is not stable or static but more complex.
- Slight periodic pattern: Suggests that there is a slight repetitive pattern in the acceleration values.

Considering these characteristics, the classification for the given data sample would be:

[Class: move to left]

Explanation:
Based on the description, the sample has few changes in direction and a big decreasing trend, which indicates a movement towards the left. Additionally, the sample is described as dynamic, which means the movement is more complex. Lastly, the slight periodic pattern suggests that there is a slight repetitive pattern in the acceleration values, which is consistent with the movement towards the left.

[Class: move to left]
Based on the description of the classes, we can analyze the given data sample as follows:

1. "Few changes in the direction": This means that the acceleration in the x-axis dimension remains relatively consistent without many abrupt changes.

2. "Big decreasing trend": This implies that the values of acceleration in the x-axis dimension are decreasing significantly over the observed time period.

3. "Few increasing values": This indicates that there are only a limited number of instances where the acceleration values in the x-axis dimension increase.

4. "Dynamic": This suggests that the sample is not stable and exhibits some degree of movement or variation.

5. "Slight periodic pattern": This means that there is a subtle repetitive pattern observed in the data, which may suggest some periodic behavior.

Based on the given characteristics, the given data sample can be classified as "move to left" because there are few changes in the direction, there is a big decreasing trend, there are few increasing values, the sample is dynamic, and there is a slight periodic pattern. 

[Class: move to left]
Based on the given description, the data sample can be classified as "shake hand". 

Explanation: 
- The description states that there are few changes in the direction, indicating a relatively stable movement.
- The description also mentions a big decreasing trend, suggesting a consistent decline in acceleration over time.
- Additionally, the description states that there are few increasing values, indicating minimal instances of acceleration increasing in the positive direction.
- The sample is described as dynamic, which means it is not stable but rather shows some complexity or variation in the acceleration pattern.
- Lastly, the description mentions a slight periodic pattern, indicating some recurring pattern in the data.

Based on these characteristics, the closest match among the given gestures is "shake hand". 

[Class: shake hand]
Based on the given description, the data sample can be classified as 'shake hand'.

Explanation: 
- The description states that there are few changes in the direction. This indicates that the data points do not have many abrupt variations in the acceleration in the x-axis dimension.
- The description also mentions a big decreasing trend. This implies that the acceleration values show a considerable decrease over time.
- Additionally, the description states that there are few increasing values. This suggests that there are only a few instances where the acceleration values increase.
- The description mentions that the sample is dynamic, which implies that the acceleration values have some variation or complexity.
- Lastly, the description indicates a slight periodic pattern. This suggests that there is a recurring pattern in the acceleration values, although the pattern may not be very pronounced.

Therefore, based on the given description, the data sample can be classified as 'shake hand'.

[Class: 'shake hand']
Based on the given description and features, we can classify the data sample as 'shake hand' gesture. 

Explanation:
- Few changes in the direction suggest that the sample doesn't involve significant movements towards any specific direction.
- A big decreasing trend indicates that the values are decreasing significantly over time.
- Few increasing values imply that there are only a few instances where the values increase.
- The sample being dynamic means that it is not stable and might involve some movements or variations.
- A slight periodic pattern suggests that there is a recurring pattern or rhythm in the data, but it is not significant.

Therefore, based on the given features and their descriptions, we can classify the data sample as 'shake hand' gesture.

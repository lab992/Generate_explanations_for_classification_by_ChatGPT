Based on your descriptions, let's analyze the given data sample:

1. There's a lot of changes in the direction: This means there's frequent changes in the motion direction. This feature aligns with the behavior described for a 'shake hand' gesture.
   
2. There's a big decreasing trend: This suggests that, overall, the gesture is characterized by a move in a single direction towards decreasing values, which is characteristic of a 'move to left' gesture. 

3. There's few increasing values: This means that there's less motion in the positive (or 'increasing') direction, which aligns with the 'move to right' behavior.

However, comparing these aspects with the descriptions provided for each gesture, it seems that first and the second factors are in contradiction. 'Shake hand' would need a lot of changes in direction but no specified trend in increasing or decreasing values, while 'move to left' would require a big decreasing trend with few changes in direction. 

On the other hand, the 'move to right' gesture matches the third factor and is compatible with a 'slight decreasing trend', but it conflicts with the existence of 'a lot of changes in direction' and 'big decreasing trend'.

In conclusion, the given data doesn't clearly fit any of the gesture descriptions. However, based on the given conditions, it appears that the 'shake hand' gesture is most likely given the high frequency of changes in the direction, which is a strong characteristic of this gesture. We can infer this despite the big decreasing trend, as it's not explicitly mentioned that this gesture cannot have such a trend.

[Class: Shake Hand]
Given the described features of the sample data, it is likely that this gesture corresponds to 'Shake Hand'. This is because the first feature of ‘a lot of changes in the direction’ matches directly with the characteristic definition of 'Shake Hand'. Even though the second and third features (big decreasing trend and few increasing values) draw some comparison to 'Move to left', the 'Shake Hand' match is stronger because the crucial feature of 'changes in direction' is not mentioned for 'Move to left'.

To repeat the classification, the data sample is likely to be:

[Class: Shake Hand].
Based on the class description and the given data sample, it appears this sample belongs to the 'shake hand' class. The crucial indicator from the data sample that reveals this classification is the 'lot of changes in the direction'. The 'shake hand' class is the only one where this feature is prevalent. 

However, you also mentioned a big decreasing trend and few increasing values. Potentially, this could cause a bit of confusion as this trend indicates it might also belong to the 'move to left' class. Yet, note that in 'move to left' class, the description specifies few changes in direction, which contradicts the prevalent changes in directions in this data sample. 

Hence, despite the decreasing trend, the main factor here is the numerous changes in the direction. So, based on these observations, I would classify the data sample as 'shake hand'.

[Class: Shake Hand]
Based on the given description, your data sample clarification falls under two classes.

The first feature "There's a lot of changes in the direction" matches the 'shake hand' gesture description. In this gesture, the acceleration in x-axis dimension would have many direction changes corresponding to the back and forth movement of a handshake.

However, the subsequent features "There's a big decreasing trend" and "There's few increasing values" of your data sample align with the 'move to left' gesture description. In the 'move to left' gesture, we would expect less direction changes and a general trend of decreasing values which corresponds to a continuous movement in the negative x-axis direction. Less increasing values implies that the gesture is more to one side, which is consistent with a 'move to left' gesture.

In terms of classifying this data, we then have a conflict as the data sample matches to both 'shake hand' and 'move to left' descriptions. Therefore, classification becomes challenging without additional context or rules for conflict resolution. In practical terms, combining these traits in a single gesture is atypical, and an additional technique like weighting the features or taking into account the sequence or duration of each feature might be necessary to better classify the input.

Nevertheless, based on the given context and the weight of the features, I would classify the sample as 'move to left'. The reason is because the movements to left or right would likely maintain the directional trend for a longer duration compared to the transient changes involved in gestures like a handshake. 

[Class: Move to left]
Based on the given description, the data could be classified as 'shake hand'. This is because you provided a criterion that if there are a lot of changes in direction, we should classify the gesture as 'shake hand'. While the description does note a significant decreasing trend, the prevalence of changes in direction overrules this according to the provided classifications. It should be noted however that this might be an area of potential ambiguity in your classification rules, as they don't clearly stipulate what to do in cases of multiple applicable criteria being present.

Repeat answer : [Class: shake hand]

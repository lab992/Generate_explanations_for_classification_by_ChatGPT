Based on the provided classification rules, the data sample can be inferred as a 'shake hand' gesture. The primary reason for this is the multitude of changes in direction. 

For the 'shake hand' gesture, the significant characteristic is a high frequency of changes in direction, which is observed in the given data sample. While the sample does have a slight decreasing trend and a lot of increasing values, these characteristics are not decisive for this particular gesture since the 'shake hand' classification does not provide any specific requirements about trends or increasing values.

Hence, the multitude of directional changes primarily attribute this gesture pattern to the 'shake hand' category.
 
[Class: 'Shake hand']
Based on your given descriptions of the classes or gestures, and taking into consideration the given data sample's features:

1. There's a lot of changes in the direction.
2. There's a slight decreasing trend.
3. There's a lot of increasing values.

Taking the first factor, since there are a lot of changes in the direction, this already rules out 'move to left' and 'move to right' because according to your descriptions, these two gestures come with few changes in direction. Hence, regardless of the other trends, 'shake hand' is the only gesture left that fits the first feature.

While 'shake hand' was not associated with any specific trends in increases or decreases in values in your provided descriptions, the features of the given data (slight decreasing trend and a lot of increasing values) do not conflict with the 'shake hand' gesture, or make it any closer to the other two gestures. Therefore, even in the presence of these trends, the 'shake hand' classification still holds.

In conclusion, based on the description of the classes, and the features found in the data sample,
[Class: Shake Hand].
Based on the provided descriptions and the observed features of the data sample, I have classified the given sample as a 'shake hand' gesture. Here's why:

The given sample has 'a lot of changes in the direction', which according to your description directly corresponds to the 'shake hand' gesture. However, two additional 'slight decreasing trend' and 'a lot of increasing values' features are identified, which seem to cause some overlap with 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures. Nonetheless, the key distinguishing feature, i.e., 'a lot of changes in the direction', is only associated with the 'shake hand' gesture according to your definitions.

Therefore, considering the priority of features and the descriptions, even though there are 'a slight decreasing trend' and 'a lot of increasing values' in data, the significant 'changes in the direction' overshadow these attributes leading us to classify this gesture as a 'shake hand'.

[Class: shake hand]
The sample in question displays a lot of changes in direction, a slight decreasing trend, and many increasing values. Applying the above class descriptions to these features:

- The high amount of directional changes rules out the 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures because they demand few changes in direction. 
- Even in the presence of a slight decrease in trend and many increasing values, these still do not fit the definitions for 'move to left' or 'move to right'. 

The only definition that matches is that of 'shake hand', which requires many changes in direction. The other requirements or descriptive features for this class are not provided, but it does not matter as no other class fits the data sample.

Therefore, based on this analysis of the given features, the gesture can be classified as 'shake hand'.

[Class: Shake Hand]
The given data sample can be classified as the 'shake hand' gesture based on the given features. The presence of a lot of changes in direction generally indicates a shaking hand motion because the movement back and forth causes the direction to change frequently. 

Although there is a slight decreasing trend and a lot of increasing values which may indicate 'move to left', the characteristic of 'a lot of changes in the direction' is dominant and is only relevant to the 'shake hand' category. And according to the given gesture description, 'shake hand' is more appropriate when there are many directional changes without specific regard to increasing values or decreasing trends. 

So, based on the given descriptions and extracted features from the data sample, the most fitting gesture class for this sample is 'shake hand'.

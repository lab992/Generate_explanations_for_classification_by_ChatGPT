According to your description of classes, data samples that have few changes in the direction, a big decreasing trend, and few increasing values refer to the 'move to left' gesture. Here's why:

1. Few changes in the direction: This suggests a consistent motion in one direction, which rules out the 'shake hand' gesture which would have more varied directional changes. 

2. A big decreasing trend: This shows the motion of the hand is going from a high value towards a low value in the x-axis direction. In this case, a decreasing trend refers to the 'move to left' gesture, suggesting that the hand moves to the left.

3. Few increasing values: This suggests that the motion is rarely going towards the positive x-axis direction, further supporting the assumption that the gesture is 'move to left'. 

Based on these findings, the data sample you provided can be categorized as 'move to left'.

[Class: move to left]
Based on the description of classes, the data sample you have provided will be written as 'move to left'. This can be determined from three aspects:

1. There are a few changes in the direction: This feature matches all three classes ('shake hand', 'move to left', 'move to right'). However, it doesn't indicate 'shake hand' because 'shake hand' requires a lot of changes in the direction, which is not the case here. Hence, we're left with 'move to left' and 'move to right'. 

2. There's a big decreasing trend: Only the class 'move to left' describes a feature of having a big decreasing trend. This alone can help us conclude that the gesture is 'move to left'. Though the class 'move to right' also speaks of a decreasing trend, it specifies it as a slight decreasing trend, which does not match with our data sample.

3. There are a few increasing values: Although this feature is present in both 'move to left' and 'move to right'. The 'move to right' gesture recommends a scenario where there's a slight decreasing trend, not a big one as in our data sample. 

From all these descriptions pertinent to the data sample, we can infer that the gesture is 'move to left'.

[Class: move to left]
Based on the provided descriptions, the given data sample should be classified as 'move to left'.

Explanation:

1. Few changes in direction: According to your descriptions, both 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures can exhibit few changes in direction. Therefore, this feature alone doesn't give a clear cut on the gesture.

2. Big decreasing trend: However, you stated that a 'move to left' gesture would exhibit a big decreasing trend, differentiating it from the 'move to right' gesture which shows only a slight decreasing trend.

3. Few increasing values: Both 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures can show few increasing values according to your descriptions. This feature reaffirms our choice of 'move to left' as the gesture since you specify that it could show few increasing values unlike 'move to right' where it is expected to see a lot of increasing values.

So, by examining all the features, the given data sample is best represented by the 'move to left' gesture according to your descriptions.

[Class: move to left]
The description of your data sample suits the criteria for the 'move to left' class.

Let's break it down:

1. Few changes in direction: As specified in your description, both "move to left" and "move to right" classes have few changes in the direction. So, this metric does not help us to decisively classify the gesture. 

2. A big decreasing trend: This specific characteristic brings us closer to the "move to left" class. When defining your classes, you mentioned that if there is a prominent decreasing trend in the data, it represents a "move to left" gesture. 

3. Few increasing values: Although both "move to left" and "move to right" gestures can have few increasing values, but since we have already found a big decreasing trend in your data, the possibility of this sample belonging to the "move to left" class increases significantly. 

Based on these observations, we can infer that your described data sample represents a "move to left" gesture.

So, the final classification of your data sample is: 

[Class: move to left]
Based on your descriptions, the sample data could be classified as 'move to left' gesture.

Here's the explanation:

You mentioned that there were few changes in the direction. This is consistent with both 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures as per your classification rules but rules out the 'shake hand' gesture. 

The 'shake hand' gesture is characterized by lots of changes in direction which is not found in this sample. 

Next, you pointed out that the sample has a big decreasing trend. This is specifically associated with the 'move to left' gesture only.

Finally, you said that there are few increasing values in the data which aligns with both the 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures.

But, since the 'move to right' gesture involves a slight decreasing trend and this dataset is characterized by a big decreasing trend, it can be discounted. Therefore, the data falls into 'move to left' category as it matches all of the described characteristics for this specific gesture.

To sum up, the classification of the given description is as follows: 
[Class: 'move to left']

Based on your provided description of gestures and features, we can classify the given data sample as follows:

The data sample has a lot of changes in direction, indicating a "shake hand" gesture. However, the presence of a slight decreasing trend and few increasing values deviates from the expected characteristic of "shake hand", since you didn't specify whether or not shaking hand can have a decreasing trend or any increasing values.

However, we also notice that the features match partially with both the "move to left" and "move to right" gestures. Specifically, they share the feature of having few changes in direction, a slight decreasing trend. 

However, the "move to left" gesture is described to have a lot of increasing values, which isn't the case with the sample data. On the other hand, the "move to right" gesture is described to have few increasing values, which matches with the sample data.

Therefore, considering all of the above, the best matching gesture for this data sample is 'move to right' as it explains the features most effectively. It has a slight decreasing trend and few increasing values, regardless of the lot of changes in direction.

So, in the required format: [Class: move to right].
Given the description of the data sample which states that there are a lot of changes in direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values, this data can be classified as the 'shake hand' gesture. 

Here's why: 

1. 'Shake hand' gesture is classified by a lot of changes in direction, which matches the given data sample. It makes sense because shaking hand motion typically involves frequent alternations between forward and backward movement, i.e., a lot of changes in direction.
2. While there's a slight decreasing trend noticed, this characteristic alone is not exclusive enough to classify it as either 'move to left' or 'move to right' gesture. Both these gestures can have this characteristic. 
3. The data specification also indicates there are few increasing values, this doesn't convincingly specify a 'move to the left' gesture, which would otherwise have a lot of increasing values. Plus, it doesn't quite agree with 'move to right' which usually doesn't have an increasing trend. 

Therefore, the 'shake hand' gesture seems the most appropriate classification given the substantial amount of changes in direction even though there's a slight decreasing trend and few increasing values. 

[Class: shake hand]
According to your provided description of the classes, the data sample fits in the 'shake hand' gesture because of a large number of changes in direction. However, there is a slight confusion here, given the existence of a slight decreasing trend and a few increasing values, this could also suggest 'move to right'. But based on the priority and the available information, we consider the parameter, 'a lot of changes in the direction', as a dominant feature. 

This feature is reasonable for the 'shake hand' gesture as shaking hands involves constant changing direction back and forth hence, 'a lot of changes in the direction'. A slight decreasing trend can also be observed as the intensity of the handshake might reduce slightly over time. There can also be 'few increasing values' as sometimes, the intensity or speed might increase slightly before shaking settles down. 

Hence, even though the sample has features that might fit in 'move to right', the significant number of changes in direction leads it to be classified as 'shake hand'.

[Class: shake hand]
The data sample can be classified as 'shake hand'. This classification is based on the fact that the description states there are a lot of changes in direction. While there is a mentioned slight decreasing trend, it's also stated that there are few increasing values.

However, if we refer back to the definitions of the three gesture classes, we'll find that the defining characteristic of 'shake hand' is a lot of changes in the direction, which matches with the sample description. In contrast, 'move to left' was defined by few changes in direction and a strong decreasing trend, which is not the case here. Finally, 'move to right' was defined by the same conditions needed for 'move to left', but with few increasing values - and although this sample has few increasing values, it also does not meet the other necessary conditions.

Therefore, with reference to the descriptions of the classes given, the data sample fits best within the 'shake hand' class.

[Class: 'shake hand']
Based on the rules you provided, this data sample corresponds to the 'shake hand' gesture. The primary reason for this classification is the presence of a large number of changes in direction. Although there's a slight decreasing trend and few increasing values, the high number of direction changes predominantly characterizes the 'shake hand' gesture according to your descriptions

Therefore, my classification would be: [Class: shake hand].

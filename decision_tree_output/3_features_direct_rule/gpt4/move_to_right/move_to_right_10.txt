Based on the given descriptions, we can classify the given data sample as the gesture 'move to right'. 

Here's why:

1. The data sample has few changes in the direction. This condition matches with the descriptions for the gestures 'move to left' and 'move to right'.
2. It also has a slight decreasing trend which is a condition that matches the description for 'move to right' and not 'move to left'. A 'big' decreasing trend would imply a larger change in values and thus, would correspond to 'move to left'. But since the trend is slight, it's not 'move to left'.
3. Lastly, the data set has few increasing values. This condition is also mentioned in the description for the gesture 'move to right'. 

Assuming the classes are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases, given the information we have from the data sample, the only correct classification following the provided descriptions is 'move to right'.

[Class: Move to Right]
Based on your descriptions:

- Few changes in direction suggests that the gesture is linear, not oscillatory. Thus, the gesture cannot be 'shake hand' since it requires a lot of changes in direction.
- A slight decreasing trend suggests that the direction of the gesture is towards the left, but it doesn't provide enough evidence to classify it as 'move to left' without considering the third feature.
- Few increasing values suggest that the gesture is not heading rightward more often than left, ruling out 'move to left' based on your classification, as 'move to left' requires a lot of increasing values.

Taking all these observations into account, the most suitable class based on your descriptions for the given data sample would be the 'move to right' gesture.

Hence,  
[Class: 'move to right']
Based on your description of the classes, the given data sample can be classified as the 'move to right' class. Here's why:

The first step of your description says that if there are few changes in the direction, the classification could either be 'move to left' or 'move to right'. Since the data sample presents few changes in the direction, the possibilities narrow down to these two classes.

The second step in your classification specifies that if there is a big decreasing trend then the class is 'move to left'. However, the data sample only shows a slight decreasing trend. This doesn't match the description for 'move to left', leaving us with 'move to right'.

Finally, if there are a lot of increasing values, the classification could be 'move to left'. But the data sample has few increasing values, which aligns with the description for the class 'move to right'.

In conclusion, this classification is based on the exclusion principle by matching the conditions provided to the features in the data sample, thus we can classify this gesture as 'move to right'.

[Class: move to right]
Based on the descriptions provided, this data sample is most likely a representation of the 'move to right' gesture class. Here's why:

1. Few changes in direction: In your description, both 'move to left' and 'move to right' gestures are characterized by a few changes in direction. Since this feature is present in this sample, it rules out 'shake hand' and narrows it down to either moving left or right.

2. A slight decreasing trend: Both 'move to left' gestures have this feature but the extent to which there is a decrease determines which gesture it could be. In the case of 'move to left', you mentioned a "big decreasing trend." However, the sample shows "a slight decreasing trend," which eliminates 'move to left' from consideration.

3. Few increasing values: This feature is unique to the description of the 'move to right' gesture among your classes. Though 'move to left' can involve a decrease, it also comes with "a lot of increasing values." Given that the sample lacks these "increasing values," it further confirms that the gesture is 'move to right'.

So, putting it all together, the data sample that exhibits few changes in direction, a slight decreasing trend, and few increasing values can be best inferred as the 'move to right' gesture. 

Therefore, to summarize:

[Class: move to right].
Based on the description given, this data sample fits the description for 'move to right'. There are few changes in the direction, indicating a consistent motion in one direction. There's also a slight decreasing trend, suggesting a minor loss of speed or momentum in the gesture. Finally, there are few increasing values, which implies that the gesture doesn't include many sudden jolts or bursts of speed. 

In conclusion, the data sample best fits the 'move to right' class based on the description given. This category is characterized by few changes in direction, slight decrease in values, and few instances of increase.

[Class: move to right].

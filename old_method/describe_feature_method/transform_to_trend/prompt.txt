You are a data analyst now. I will give you a data set which shows the trend of the samples. The trend means how much the data grows or drops. For example, 5 means grow by 5, while -6 means drop by 6. There are 30 samples. Each sample is split by ‚[]’. You should think step by step. You should firstly imagine the given data set as a curve graph. Secondly, you should observe patterns of this graph. Finally, you should tell me 10 features that you observe from this dataset.  You should also rank these features from the most important to the least important. Don't show me the picture.

Your task is to classify my description of samples to 3 classes (Class 2, Class 3, Class 4). Each sample has 4 features. I will now describe these 3 classes based on these 4 features.
Class 2:
Situation1: The value of 'number_crossing_m__m_1' is high.
Situation2: The value of 'number_crossing_m__m_1' is low.The value of 'agg_linear_trend__attr_'intercept'__chunk_len_5__f_agg_'min'' is low,The value of 'approximate_entropy__m_2__r_0.7' is high.
Class 3:
Situation1: The value of 'number_crossing_m__m_1' is low.The value of 'agg_linear_trend__attr_'intercept'__chunk_len_5__f_agg_'min'' is high,The value of 'acceleration__range_count__max_1000000000000.0__min_0' is high.
Situation2: The value of 'number_crossing_m__m_1' is low.The value of 'agg_linear_trend__attr_'intercept'__chunk_len_5__f_agg_'min'' is low,The value of 'approximate_entropy__m_2__r_0.7' is low.
Class 4:
The value of 'number_crossing_m__m_1' is low.The value of 'agg_linear_trend__attr_'intercept'__chunk_len_5__f_agg_'min'' is high,The value of 'acceleration__range_count__max_1000000000000.0__min_0' is low.
Try to classify following 15 data to these 3 classes. You must classify according to the description of classes. Don't show me the code but give the answer directly. You must give me the answer in format: [sample 1, sample 2, ..., sample 15]. For example: [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4]You must check whether there are exactly 15 samples in your answer.

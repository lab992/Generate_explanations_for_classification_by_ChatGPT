[Class: shake hand]
Based on the given description, the sample can be classified as 'shake hand'.

Explanation:
In the description of the 'shake hand' gesture, it is mentioned that there are many changes in the direction, regardless of the other features. In the given sample, it is stated that there are a big number of changes in the direction, indicating a high level of variability in the acceleration values. Additionally, the decreasing trend in the acceleration values when they are low is also mentioned, implying that there could be fluctuations in the acceleration along with changes in direction. However, as the description does not specify anything about the proportion of values falling within a specific range, we don't consider that feature for classification.

Therefore, based on the description and the presence of many changes in the direction, the sample can be classified as 'shake hand'.

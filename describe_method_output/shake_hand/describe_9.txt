To determine the class that the given array belongs to, we need to follow the steps mentioned for each situation.

Situation 1: When there's a 0 in the array, there should be a 9 after 0.

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

Situation 2: When there's a 9 in the array, there should be a 0 after 9.

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

Now let's analyze the given array.

Starting with Situation 1:
Step 1: Find a 0 first - There is a 0 present in the array.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0 - There is a 9 after the first occurrence of 0.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0 - The index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

Moving on to Situation 2:
Step 1: Find a 9 first - There is a 9 present in the array.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9 - After the first occurrence of 9, there are no subsequent 0s.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9 - N/A.

Based on the analysis above, the given array satisfies Situation 1 but does not satisfy Situation 2. Therefore, the class that this array belongs to is 'Result: Class3'.
------------------------
To classify which class the given array belongs to, we need to go through the steps mentioned for each question.

Question 1: Is there a 'Situation 1'?

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

Based on the given array, we can see that there is a 0 present. Now we need to check if there is a 9 after 0. Looking at the array, we see that there is a 9 after the 0. Finally, we need to check if the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0. In this case, the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

So, the given array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Question 2: Is there a 'Situation 2'?

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

Based on the given array, we can see that there is a 9 present. Now we need to check if there is a 0 after 9. Looking at the array, we do not see a 0 after the 9. So, the given array does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Now, we can classify the given array.

Since the given array satisfies 'Situation 1' and does not satisfy 'Situation 2', it belongs to 'Class 3'.

Result: Class3
------------------------
To classify the given array, we need to evaluate both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

For 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Find a 0.
Step 2: Check if there's a 9 after 0.
Step 3: Check if the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

For 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Find a 9.
Step 2: Check if there's a 0 after 9.
Step 3: Check if the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

Using these steps, let's evaluate the given array.

1. Evaluate 'Situation 1':
- Step 1: Find a 0. (Index: 45)
- Step 2: Check if there's a 9 after 0. (Yes, at Index: 46)
- Step 3: Check if the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0. (Yes, 46 > 45)

2. Evaluate 'Situation 2':
- Step 1: Find a 9. (Index: 74)
- Step 2: Check if there's a 0 after 9. (No, there is no 0 after 9)
- Step 3: Check if the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9. (N/A)

Based on the evaluation of both situations, the given array satisfies 'Situation 1' but not 'Situation 2.' Thus, it belongs to 'Class 3'.

Result: Class3
------------------------
Step 1: Find a 0 first.
The array contains a 0 at index 46.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Yes, there is a 9 after 0 at index 47.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 (index 47) is greater than the index of 0 (index 46).

Since the sample satisfies 'Situation 1', we proceed to question 2.

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
The array contains a 9 at index 103.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
No, there is no 0 after 9.

Therefore, the sample does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Based on the given classification criteria, the answer is:

Result: Class 3
------------------------
To classify which class the given array belongs to, we need to analyze if it satisfies 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2' based on the given criteria.

Step 1: Finding a 0 and checking if there's a 9 after it.
In the given array, there is a 0 present at index 54. After verifying, we can see that there is a 9 present after the 0 at index 55. Also, the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

Step 2: Finding a 9 and checking if there's a 0 after it.
In the given array, there is a 9 present at index 127. After verifying, we can see that there is a 0 present after the 9 at index 128. Also, the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

Based on the analysis, the given array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'. Hence, the answer is:

Result: Class2

Result: Class4
------------------------
To determine the class that the given array belongs to, we need to check for the presence of "Situation 1" and "Situation 2" as described in the problem statement.

First, let's check for "Situation 1":
Step 1: Find a 0 - We can see that there is a 0 in the array.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0 - There is no 9 after 0 in the array.
Since "Situation 1" is not satisfied, we can rule out "Class 3".

Next, let's check for "Situation 2":
Step 1: Find a 9 - We can see that there is a 9 in the array.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9 - There is no 0 after 9 in the array.
Since "Situation 2" is not satisfied, we can rule out "Class 4".

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the given array does not satisfy both "Situation 1" and "Situation 2". Therefore, the array belongs to "Class 2".

Result: Class 2
------------------------
Based on the provided data, let's go through the classification process step by step:

Question 1:
Step 1: Find a 0.
- There is a 0 in the array.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
- There is a 9 after the 0.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
- The index of the 9 (index 45) is greater than the index of the 0 (index 43).

Therefore, the array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Question 2:
Step 1: Find a 9.
- There is a 9 in the array.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
- There is a 0 after the 9.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
- The index of the 0 (index 45) is not greater than the index of the 9 (index 43).

Therefore, the array does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Based on the classification criteria provided, the array belongs to 'Class 3', as it satisfies 'Situation 1' but does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Result: Class 3
------------------------
To classify the given array, we will follow the steps outlined in the prompt.

Question 1: Is there a 'Situation 1'?

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
The array contains a 0.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Yes, there is a 9 after the 0.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of the 9 (index 49) is greater than the index of the 0 (index 46).

The array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Question 2: Is there a 'Situation 2'?

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
The array contains a 9.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
There is no 0 after the 9.

The array does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Based on the results above, the array belongs to 'Class 3'.

Result: Class3
------------------------
To determine the class to which the given array belongs, we need to analyze the array against the conditions mentioned in the problem.

Question 1: Is there a 'Situation 1'?
To answer this question, we need to find if there is a 0 in the array and if there is a 9 following the 0 with a greater index.

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
We can see that there is a 0 in the array.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Next, we need to check if there is a 9 following the 0. From the given array, we can see that there is a 9 after the 0.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
Now, we compare the indices of 0 and 9. The index of 0 is 47, and the index of 9 is 46. Since the index of 9 is less than the index of 0, 'Situation 1' is not satisfied.

Therefore, the given array does not satisfy 'Situation 1'.

Question 2: Is there a 'Situation 2'?
To answer this question, we need to find if there is a 9 in the array and if there is a 0 following the 9 with a greater index.

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
From the given array, we can see that there is a 9 present.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Now, we need to check if there is a 0 following the 9. In the given array, there is no 0 after the 9.

Therefore, the given array does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Based on the analysis, the given array does not satisfy either 'Situation 1' or 'Situation 2', which means it does not belong to 'Class 2', 'Class 3', or 'Class 4'.

Result: None of the classes (Class 2, Class 3, or Class 4)

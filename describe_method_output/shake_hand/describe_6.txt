To classify which class the given array belongs to, we need to evaluate both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

For 'Situation 1', we need to check if there is a 0 followed by a 9 with the index of 9 being greater than the index of 0.

For 'Situation 2', we need to check if there is a 9 followed by a 0 with the index of 0 being greater than the index of 9.

Let's evaluate the given array step by step for both situations:

For 'Situation 1':
1. Step1: Find a 0 first.
   Index: 32

2. Step2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
   Yes, there is a 9 after the 0.

3. Step3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
   The index of 9 is 55, and the index of 0 is 31. So, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the given array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

For 'Situation 2':
1. Step1: Find a 9 first.
   Index: 46

2. Step2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
   Yes, there is a 0 after the 9.

3. Step3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
   The index of 0 is 33, and the index of 9 is 45. So, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the given array satisfies 'Situation 2'.

Since the given array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', we can classify it as 'Class 2'.

To classify the given array, we will follow the steps outlined in the problem.

Question 1: Is there a 'Situation 1'?

Step 1: We start by looking for a 0 in the array. The first occurrence of 0 is at index 32.

Step 2: After finding a 0, we check if there is a 9 following it. In this case, there is a 9 at index 42.

Step 3: We compare the indices of the 0 and the 9. The index of 0 (32) is less than the index of 9 (42).

Since all the conditions for 'Situation 1' are met, we can conclude that 'Situation 1' is present.

Question 2: Is there a 'Situation 2'?

Step 1: We start by looking for a 9 in the array. The first occurrence of 9 is at index 42.

Step 2: After finding a 9, we check if there is a 0 following it. In this case, there is a 0 at index 43.

Step 3: We compare the indices of the 9 and the 0. The index of 9 (42) is less than the index of 0 (43).

Since all the conditions for 'Situation 2' are met, we can conclude that 'Situation 2' is present.

Based on the presence of both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', the array belongs to 'Class 2'.

Answer: Result: Class2
------------------------
To classify the given array into one of the classes, we will follow the steps for each question:

Question 1: Is there a 'Situation 1'?

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
In the given array, there is a 0 at index 31.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
In the given array, there is a 9 after the 0 at index 36.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 (36) is greater than the index of 0 (31).

Since all the steps for 'Situation 1' are satisfied, we can conclude that the given array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Question 2: Is there a 'Situation 2'?

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
In the given array, there is a 9 at index 46.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
In the given array, there is a 0 after the 9 at index 47.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
The index of 0 (47) is greater than the index of 9 (46).

Since all the steps for 'Situation 2' are satisfied, we can conclude that the given array satisfies 'Situation 2'.

Based on the conditions mentioned, the given array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'. Therefore, the answer is:

Result: Class2

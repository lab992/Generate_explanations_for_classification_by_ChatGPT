To determine the class to which the given array belongs, we need to assess whether it satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'. 

Taking into account 'Situation 1', let's go through the steps:
Step 1: We need to find a 0 first. Going through the array, we do find a 0 at index 76.
Step 2: After finding the 0, we check if there is a 9 after it. Analyzing the array, we find a 9 at index 84.
Step 3: Comparing the indices of the 0 and the 9, we see that the index of 9 (84) is greater than the index of 0 (76).

Therefore, the given array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Now, let's consider 'Situation 2', following the steps:
Step 1: We need to find a 9 first. Looking at the array, we find a 9 at index 68.
Step 2: After finding the 9, we need to check if there is a 0 after it. Examining the array, we can see a 0 at index 70.
Step 3: Comparing the indices of the 9 and the 0, we notice that the index of 0 (70) is indeed greater than the index of 9 (68).

Therefore, the given array also satisfies 'Situation 2'.

As the array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', we can conclude that the array belongs to 'Class 2'.

Therefore, the answer is: Result: Class2.
------------------------
Based on the provided information, let's go through the steps for classifying the given array:

Question 1: Is there a 'Situation 1'?
Step 1: Find a 0 first. The array does contain a 0.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0. The array does not have a 9 after 0.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0. Since there is no 9 after 0, this condition does not apply. 

Therefore, this array does not satisfy 'Situation 1'.

Question 2: Is there a 'Situation 2'?
Step 1: Find a 9 first. The array does contain a 9.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9. The array does have a 0 after 9.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9. The index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

Therefore, this array satisfies 'Situation 2'.

Based on the classification criteria, this array belongs to 'Class 4'.

Result: Class4
------------------------
To determine which class the given array belongs to, let's go through the step-by-step process for both Situation 1 and Situation 2.

Situation 1:
Step 1: Find a 0 first.
In the given array, there is a 0 at index 74.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
There is no 9 after the 0 at index 74.

Therefore, the given array does not satisfy Situation 1.

Situation 2:
Step 1: Find a 9 first.
In the given array, there is a 9 at index 61.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
There is a 0 after the 9 at index 61.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
The index of 0 (index 62) is greater than the index of 9 (index 61).

Therefore, the given array satisfies Situation 2.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the given array satisfies Situation 2, and thus belongs to 'Class 4'.

Result: Class4
------------------------
First, let's analyze Question 1.

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
In the given array, there is a 0 at index 86.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
In the given array, there is a 9 after the 0 at index 88.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of the 9 (index 88) is greater than the index of the 0 (index 86).

Since all three conditions are satisfied, this array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Next, let's analyze Question 2.

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
In the given array, there is a 9 at index 58.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
In the given array, there is no 0 after the 9 at index 58.

Since there is no 0 after the 9, this array does not satisfy 'Situation 2'.

Based on the results of both questions, this array belongs to 'Class 3'.

Result: Class3
------------------------
After analyzing the given time-series data sample, it can be concluded that the given array belongs to the 'Class 3'.

Explanation:
By applying the rules mentioned for 'Situation 1', we can see that there is a '0' at index 68 and a '9' at index 75. Furthermore, the index of '9' is greater than the index of '0'. Therefore, the array satisfies 'Situation 1' and can be classified as 'Class 3'.

Result: Class3

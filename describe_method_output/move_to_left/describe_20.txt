To classify which class the given array belongs to, we will follow the steps outlined for Question 1 and Question 2.

For Question 1 (Situation 1):

Step 1: Find a 0 first.

In the given array, we can see that there are two occurrences of 0.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.

After the first occurrence of 0, there is no 9 present.
After the second occurrence of 0, there is a 9 present.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

For the second occurrence of 0, the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

Since the given array satisfies all the conditions of Situation 1, it falls under 'Class 3'.

For Question 2 (Situation 2):

Step 1: Find a 9 first.

In the given array, we can see that there is one occurrence of 9.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.

After the occurrence of 9, there is no 0 present.

The given array does not satisfy the conditions of Situation 2.

Based on the analysis, the given array belongs to 'Class 3'.

Result: Class3
------------------------
To classify the given array, we will follow the steps outlined in the question.

For 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Find a 0 first.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

For 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Find a 9 first.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

For 'Situation 1':
Step 1: There is a 0 at index 14.
Step 2: There is a 9 after the 0 at index 15.
Step 3: The index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

So 'Situation 1' is satisfied.

For 'Situation 2':
Step 1: There is a 9 at index 20.
Step 2: There is a 0 after the 9 at index 21.
Step 3: The index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

So 'Situation 2' is satisfied.

Since the array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', we can classify it as 'Class 2'.

Therefore, the answer is: 'Result: Class 2'.
------------------------
To determine the class, we need to follow the steps outlined in the instructions.

For 'Situation 1':
1. Find a 0 first - The sample contains a 0 at index 14.
2. Find if there's a 9 after 0 - There is no 9 after 0 in the sample.
Since the sample does not satisfy 'Situation 1', it cannot belong to 'Class 2' or 'Class 3'.

For 'Situation 2':
1. Find a 9 first - The sample contains a 9 at index 19.
2. Find if there's a 0 after 9 - There is a 0 after 9 in the sample at index 20.
3. Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9 - The index of 0 (index 20) is greater than the index of 9 (index 19).
Since the sample satisfies 'Situation 2', it belongs to 'Class 4'.

Therefore, the answer is: 'Result: Class4'
------------------------
To determine the class that the given array belongs to, we need to analyze whether the array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

Let's start with 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Find a 0 first.
The array contains a 0 at index 14.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Yes, there is a 9 after the 0 in the array.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 is 15, which is greater than the index of 0, which is 14.

Now let's move to 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Find a 9 first.
The array does not contain a 9.

Based on the analysis, the given array satisfies 'Situation 1' but does not satisfy 'Situation 2'. According to the class definitions provided, this means that the array belongs to 'Class 3'.

Therefore, the result is: 'Result: Class 3'.
------------------------
To determine the class that this array belongs to, we need to evaluate the presence of 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2' in the sequence.

For 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Finding a 0 - we can see that there is a 0 at index 14.
Step 2: Checking for a 9 after 0 - we can see that there is a 9 at index 15.
Step 3: Comparing the indices of 0 and 9 - the index of 9 (15) is greater than the index of 0 (14).

Therefore, 'Situation 1' is present in the array.

For 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Finding a 9 - we can see that there is a 9 at index 15.
Step 2: Checking for a 0 after 9 - we can see that there is a 0 at index 16.
Step 3: Comparing the indices of 9 and 0 - the index of 0 (16) is greater than the index of 9 (15).

Therefore, 'Situation 2' is present in the array.

Since the array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', we can conclude that the array belongs to 'Class 2'.

The answer is: 'Result: Class2'.

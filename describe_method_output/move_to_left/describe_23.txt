To classify which class the given array belongs to, we need to analyze whether it satisfies 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

For 'Situation 1':
- Step1: Find a 0 first. The array contains a 0 at index 36.
- Step2: Find if there's a 9 after 0. There is a 9 after 0 in the array.
- Step3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0. The index of 9 (index 30) is less than the index of 0 (index 36).

Since 'Situation 1' is not satisfied, we can conclude that the array does not belong to 'Class 3'.

For 'Situation 2':
- Step1: Find a 9 first. The array contains a 9 at index 31.
- Step2: Find if there's a 0 after 9. There is a 0 after 9 in the array.
- Step3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9. The index of 0 (index 35) is greater than the index of 9 (index 31).

Since 'Situation 2' is satisfied, we can conclude that the array belongs to 'Class 4'.

Therefore, the result is: Class4
------------------------
Step 1: Find a 0 first.
The array contains a 0 at index 35.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Yes, there is a 9 after the 0.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 is 31, which is greater than the index of 0 (index 35).

Since both Situation 1 and Situation 2 are satisfied by the given array, the array belongs to Class 2.

Result: Class 2
------------------------
Result: Class2
------------------------
To classify the array based on the given conditions, we need to go through the steps for both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'. 

For 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Find a 0 first - the array contains two zeros, at index 35 and 36. 
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0 - there is a 9 after the first zero at index 38.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0 - the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.

For 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Find a 9 first - the array contains three nines, at index 30, 31, and 32. 
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9 - there is a 0 after the first nine at index 33.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9 - the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.

Based on the results of both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', we can conclude that the array belongs to 'Class 2' since it satisfies both conditions.

Result: Class2
------------------------
To classify the given array, we need to determine if it satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

For 'Situation 1':
Step 1: We need to find a 0 in the array. The array does contain a 0 at index 40.
Step 2: After finding the 0, we need to check if there is a 9 after it. In this case, there is a 9 after the 0.
Step 3: Lastly, we check if the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0. In this case, the index of 9 (index 30) is indeed greater than the index of 0.

Since the array satisfies 'Situation 1', it falls into either 'Class 2' or 'Class 3' categories.

For 'Situation 2':
Step 1: We need to find a 9 in the array. The array does contain a 9 at index 31.
Step 2: After finding the 9, we need to check if there is a 0 after it. In this case, there is not a 0 after the 9.
Step 3: Since there is no 0 after the 9, we disregard this step for 'Situation 2'.

Since the array does not satisfy 'Situation 2', it cannot belong to 'Class 4'.

Therefore, the result is: 'Result: Class3'.

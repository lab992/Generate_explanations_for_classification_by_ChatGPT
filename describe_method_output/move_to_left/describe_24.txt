To classify which class the given array belongs to, we need to go through the steps mentioned for both Situation 1 and Situation 2.

Situation 1:
Step 1: Find a 0 first.
Looking at the given array, we can see that there is a 0 at index 6.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Checking the elements after index 6, we find that there is a 9 at index 13.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 (13) is indeed greater than the index of 0 (6).

Since the array satisfies Situation 1, it can potentially belong to Class 2 or Class 3.

Situation 2:
Step 1: Find a 9 first.
Looking at the given array, we can see that there is a 9 at index 13.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Checking the elements after index 13, we find that there is a 0 at index 14.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
The index of 0 (14) is indeed greater than the index of 9 (13).

Since the array also satisfies Situation 2, it can be classified as Class 2.

Therefore, the answer is: Result: Class 2
------------------------
To classify which class the given array belongs to, we need to determine if it satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.
Let's go step by step:
Question 1: Is there a 'Situation 1'?

Step 1: Find a 0 first.
The first occurrence of 0 is at index 6.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
After the 0 at index 6, there is a 9 at index 13.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 (index 13) is indeed greater than the index of 0 (index 6).

Therefore, the given array satisfies 'Situation 1'.

Question 2: Is there a 'Situation 2'?

Step 1: Find a 9 first.
The first occurrence of 9 is at index 13.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
There is a 0 after the 9 at index 13, at index 14.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
The index of 0 (index 14) is indeed greater than the index of 9 (index 13).

Therefore, the given array satisfies 'Situation 2'.

Since the given array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', it belongs to 'Class 2'.

Result: Class2
------------------------
To classify the given array, we need to analyze whether it satisfies 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2' as described.

First, let's consider 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Find a 0 first.
From the given array, we can see that there is a 0 at the 6th index.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0.
Again, looking at the array, we can see that there is a 9 at the 13th index after the 0.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0.
The index of 9 (13th index) is greater than the index of 0 (6th index).

Since the array satisfies all the conditions for 'Situation 1', it can be classified as 'Class 3'.

Next, let's consider 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Find a 9 first.
From the given array, we can see that there is a 9 at the 13th index.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9.
Looking at the array, we can see that there is a 0 at the 15th index after the 9.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9.
The index of 0 (15th index) is greater than the index of 9 (13th index).

Since the array satisfies all the conditions for 'Situation 2' as well, it can be classified as 'Class 2'.

Therefore, the final classification is: 'Result: Class2'.
------------------------
To classify which class the given array belongs to, we need to check if it satisfies Condition 1 (Situation 1) and Condition 2 (Situation 2) sequentially.

Step 1: Condition 1 (Situation 1)
- Find a 0 first: The array contains a 0 at index 6.

Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0: 
- There is a 9 after the 0 at index 13.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0: 
- The index of 9 (index 13) is greater than the index of 0 (index 6).

Since the array satisfies Condition 1 (Situation 1), we move on to Condition 2 (Situation 2).

Step 1: Condition 2 (Situation 2)
- Find a 9 first: The array contains a 9 at index 13.

Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9: 
- There is a 0 after the 9 at index 14.

Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9: 
- The index of 0 (index 14) is greater than the index of 9 (index 13).

Since the array satisfies both Condition 1 (Situation 1) and Condition 2 (Situation 2), we can classify the array as 'Class 2'.

Therefore, the answer is:

Result: Class 2.
------------------------
To classify the given array, we need to check if it satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2'.

First, we will check for 'Situation 1':
Step 1: Find a 0 first. The array contains a 0 at index 6.
Step 2: Find if there's a 9 after 0. The array contains a 9 after the 0 at index 7.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 9 is greater than the index of 0. Since the index of 9 (index 13) is greater than the index of 0 (index 6), 'Situation 1' is satisfied.

Next, we will check for 'Situation 2':
Step 1: Find a 9 first. The array contains a 9 at index 13.
Step 2: Find if there's a 0 after 9. The array contains a 0 after the 9 at index 14.
Step 3: Check whether the index of 0 is greater than the index of 9. Since the index of 0 (index 14) is greater than the index of 9 (index 13), 'Situation 2' is satisfied.

Since the given array satisfies both 'Situation 1' and 'Situation 2', the result is: 'Result: Class2'.

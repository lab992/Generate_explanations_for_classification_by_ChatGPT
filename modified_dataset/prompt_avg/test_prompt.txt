You are a data analyst now. I will give you a data set, which is a time-series data set. Each data ranges from 0 to 10. Your mission is to tell me whether each sample belongs to "Class 1" with the help of following 3 questions.

"number A" means 0 or 1
"number B" means 9 or 10
"Situation 1" : When the index of "number A" is smaller than the index of  "number B".
"Situation 2" : When the index of "number A" is bigger than the index of  "number B".

Question1: Is there a "Situation 1"?
Question2: Is there a "Situation 2"?
Question3: Is there periodic fluctuation?

You should think Question 1 step by step.
Step1: List the array with index
Step2: Start with index 0
Step3: Find "number A" and the closest "number B"
Step4: Check whether the index of "number B" is bigger than "number A".
Step5: Check whether number A and number B and their index really belongs to the array.

You should think Question 2 step by step.
Step1: List the array with index
Step2: Start with index 0
Step3: Find "number B" and the closest "number A"
Step4: Check whether the index of "number B" is smaller than "number A".
Step5: Check whether number A and number B and their index really belongs to the array.

You should think Question 3 by imagine a curve graph. Then you should observe whether there's a periodic fluctuation.

"Class 1" should have 3 patterns:
1. There's no periodic fluctuation.
2. There's a "Situation 1".
3. There's no "Situation 2".

Now I will give you 10 arrays. Classify if each sample belongs to "Class 1".
You should classify these arrays perspectively. If an array belongs to "Class 1", you should return "True", otherwise "False". You must give me the answer in format: [array 1, array 2, ..., array 10].

Following are 10 classes:
1. [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 9, 10, 10, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6]

Don't show me the code or curve graph. Just give me the answer.
